## Log

- **A0 done.** Read every pipeline entry point from source and wrote
  `backend/INTEGRATION_NOTES.md`: data models to reuse, per-stage entry points
  (collect/goal/explore/distill/score), the exact candidate-run-under-replay
  recipe, and the replay world. **Key finding:** the pipeline computes *only*
  the effect verdict — there is no answer-matching scorer in `dmcp/` (invariant
  #1), so the Effect⇄Answer toggle's `answer_pass` is a studio-side demo foil,
  never a benchmark number.
- **Skeleton created.** `dmcp-studio/{backend,frontend,experiments,scripts}`
  per build plan §3 (the demo *paper* stays in `paper_demo/`, so
  `dmcp-studio/paper/` is intentionally omitted).

## Open decisions to confirm before A1

- **Dependency:** A1 needs FastAPI + an SSE helper (uvicorn, sse-starlette or
  manual). Proposed as an optional `[studio]` extra in `pyproject.toml` so core
  `dmcp` stays lean (CLAUDE.md: no heavy dep without PR discussion).
- **Sandbox default-deny** gets a unit test in A1 (build plan §10).
